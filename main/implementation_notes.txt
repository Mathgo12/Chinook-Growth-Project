#  Evaluating the Effectiveness of Random Forest with r^2 values:
    - Compute the r^2 test and train values for each dataset, place them as new columns to 'hyper_params.csv'
    - Compute the difference between r2_train and r2_test --> generally a small difference is better, especially with r2_trains close to 1
    - Display these differences on Box Plots. Set the x-axis as the number of features or nonlinear
    - Save the box plot summary statistics - median, IQR, outliers

# Analyzing Variable Importance with Simulation Testing
    1. Find the variable importance for random forest trained on each simulated dataset
    2. Set this variable importance as a new column in each 'Imp.csv'
    3. Display the rankings of random forest variable importance (e.g. on bar graphs) alongside the rankings of the simulated variable importance
    4. Compute the covariance between these two variable importance metrics
    5. Display the covariance on a box plot
    6. Save box plot summary statistics
